<h3>SARKEESIAN, </h3>

Heroic women in science fiction and fantasy television shows have done much
to represent strong, successful women in leadership positions. However, these female
roles that are viewed as strong and empowered embody many masculine identified
traits, maintaining a patriarchal division of gender roles  (SARKEESIAN, 2010, p. ii)

<h3>SARKEESIAN, </h3>

This project began as I was watching TV and found myself identifying with
and rooting for the strong female heroes. As I looked critically at their roles, I noticed
that many of them were replicating the traditional male hero archetype and
‘masculine’ defined values (SARKEESIAN, 2010, p. iii)

<h3>SARKEESIAN, </h3>

The women that are identified as strong and tough, nearly always possess
physical strength, rarely ask for help, and hardly ever show emotion unless forced.
Strength remains a central attribute to female characters, and is seemingly highly
valued both by society and within fandoms (SARKEESIAN, 2010, p. 07)

<h3>SARKEESIAN, </h3>

While there are instances of female ‘braniacs' and scientists,
and of sensitive women who help devise plans, or are good wives, daughters, mothers
or teachers, these traits are often reserved for supporting characters, not starring roles. (SARKEESIAN, 2010, p. 07)

<h3>SARKEESIAN, </h3>

I especially gravitated
towards science fiction and fantasy programs because as I was attempting to imagine
a future economic and social system that is rooted in social justice values, I
anticipated that science fiction was a place that would portray futuristic societies with
different values. (SARKEESIAN, 2010, p. 08)

<h3>SARKEESIAN, </h3>

I also began to notice that I identified
with and enjoyed watching the women who I was viewing. They have many
commonalities: they were strong, in charge, capable, confident and intelligent. (SARKEESIAN, 2010, p. 08)

<h3>SARKEESIAN, </h3>

Strong women are indeed sexualized and “feminized” in sometimes degrading ways,
but generally the aspects that are viewed as positive such as leadership, courage, and
independence are deeply identified as masculine.
 (SARKEESIAN, 2010, p. 08)

<h3>SARKEESIAN, </h3>

Female roles in science fiction and fantasy television that are viewed as strong
and empowered embody many masculine identified traits, maintaining a patriarchal
division of gender roles. (SARKEESIAN, 2010, p. 09)

<h3>SARKEESIAN, </h3>

I will attempt to continue the conversation about women’s representations in
speculative fiction television and expose the ways in which our society is influenced
by how female characters are written, cast and developed. (SARKEESIAN, 2010, p. 10)

<h3>SARKEESIAN, </h3>

I borrow from hooks’ elucidation of gendered value systems to observe how even if
gender roles are swapped (e.g. women adopting typically masculine heroic roles)
women’s representations on television still uphold patriarchal values (SARKEESIAN, 2010, p. 11)

<h3>SARKEESIAN, </h3>

Some contemporary female characters are more than simply
passive, but even in their active roles they are still created and cast for “erotic impact”
and “to-be-looked-at-ness” (SARKEESIAN, 2010, p. 11)

<h3>SARKEESIAN, </h3>

Female action heroes, although not helpless,
are still subject to the male gaze in a way that male heroes are not. (SARKEESIAN, 2010, p. 12)

<h3>SARKEESIAN, </h3>

Usually strong female characters can be put into something leather, revealing, or
otherwise “girlie” which grounds their identity as essentially feminine and thus makes
it acceptable for them to exude a masculine attitude without challenging their
sexuality. (SARKEESIAN, 2010, p. 13)

<h3>SARKEESIAN, </h3>

Even women
who do attain positions of power such as politicians are subject to overt sexualization
in a way that their male counterparts typically are not
(Wakeman, 2008) (SARKEESIAN, 2010, p. 14)

<h3>SARKEESIAN, </h3>

Women, people of colour, queer folks, and those with
disabilities are relegated to the love interest, the sidekick, or just background. (SARKEESIAN, 2010, p. 14)

<h3>SARKEESIAN, </h3>

For
instance, people of colour and queer people have a far higher chance of being killed
than their white counterparts (see appendix) (SARKEESIAN, 2010, p. 15)

<h3>SARKEESIAN, </h3>

Stereotypical gender-specific attributes are often identified in
opposition to one another with the “masculine” traits valued over “feminine” traits. (SARKEESIAN, 2010, p. 16)

<h3>SARKEESIAN, </h3>

The male dominated television industry introduced (pseudo) tough female characters
because it opened up another profitable market of potential consumers. To maintain ad revenue, they created the “empowered woman” that would appeal to women
desiring female characters beyond housewives and maids and also to male viewers by
putting the characters in sexy outfits and giving them fancy weapons. Women would
be happy to see a butt-kicking badass on TV each week and men could ogle the “hot
chick” in skimpy clothes. (SARKEESIAN, 2010, p. 16-17)

<h3>SARKEESIAN, </h3>

However, she observes that the role reversal
remains too shocking, that tough female characters possess attributes that remind the
viewer that these tough women are still women after all. (SARKEESIAN, 2010, p. 18)

<h3>SARKEESIAN, </h3>

Although she does not argue that fully “masculine” women are the
solution to the lack of strong women, she does identify these “feminine” markers as
problematic (SARKEESIAN, 2010, p. 18)

<h3>SARKEESIAN, </h3>

Strong, tough female
characters have become more serious, more common and more accepted, but still
possess many of the same qualities Inness outlined. (SARKEESIAN, 2010, p. 18)

<h3>SARKEESIAN, </h3>

Both characters still perform “masculine”
acts in terms of conflict resolution and general interpersonal relations. (SARKEESIAN, 2010, p. 18)

<h3>SARKEESIAN, </h3>

Because, “soldier identities are ‘embodied’ by, and embody, heterosexual
masculinity—an embodiment whose integrity depends upon the externalization of the
feminine” (Theweleit, 1987, as cited in Buttsworth, 2002, p. 8) it is subversive to
place a physically feminine character such as Buffy into a warrior archetype. (SARKEESIAN, 2010, p. 19)

<h3>SARKEESIAN, </h3>

In “Equally Super?:
Gender-Role Stereotyping of Superheroes in Children’s Animated Programs,” Baker
and Raney (2007) further observed “[that] females must compensate for being
portrayed as strong and powerful by emphasizing other traditional feminine traits
unassociated with power is not exclusive to children’s animated programming” (p.
37). These findings have also been proven by Inness in representations of tough
women in film and television. (SARKEESIAN, 2010, p. 20)

<h3>SARKEESIAN, </h3>

While deeply immersed in this categorization process, I noticed recurring
tropes in these female characters that are both degrading and troubling. In many
cases, women are often violated, have their bodies taken over by an alien life form or
are forcibly impregnated. (SARKEESIAN, 2010, p. 20)

<h3>SARKEESIAN, </h3>

For example, the strong female
character would have an aesthetically strong appearance through demonstrable muscles, be physically fit, and have a particular physical style that may include a
leather warrior outfit or a military uniform. Strong characters demonstrate leadership
or a dominant, independent attitude. (SARKEESIAN, 2010, p. 21-22)

<h3>SARKEESIAN, </h3>

The hero is one of the most common archetypes and can be identified in
nearly all Hollywood films. Since many of these archetypes predate any feminist
analysis, they were typically written specifically for men and it is not surprising that
nearly all the identifiable strong women seem to be written within the masculine
boundaries of the hero and the villain. (SARKEESIAN, 2010, p. 23)
