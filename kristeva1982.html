<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

There looms, within abjection, one of those violent, dark revolts of being, directed agaisnt a threat that seems to emanate from an exorbitant outside or inside, ejected beyond the scope of the possible, the tolerable, the thinkable. It lies there, quite close, but it cannot be assimilated (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 01)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

The abject is not an ob-ject facing me, which I name or imagine. Nor is it an ob-jest, an otherness ceaselessly fleeing in a systematic quest of desire. What it abject is not my correlative, which, providing me with someone or something else as support, would allow me to be more or less detached and autonomous (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 01)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

To each ego its object, to each soperego its abject (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 02)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

A massive and sudden emergence of uncanniness, which, familiar as it might have been in an opaque and forgotten life, now harries me as radically separate, loathsome. Not me. Not that. But not nothing, either. A "something" that I do not recgnize as a thing. A wight of meaninglessness, about which there is nothing insignificant, and which crushes me. On the edge of non-existence and hallucination, of a reality that, if I acknowledge it, annihilates me. There, abject and abjection are my safeguards. The primers of my culture (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 02)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Food loathing is perhaps the most elementary and most archaic form of abjection (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 02)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

But since the foos is not an "other" for "me", who am only in their desire, I expel <i>myself</i>, I spit </i<myself</i> out, I abject <i>myself</i> within the same motion through which "I" claim to establish <i>myself</i>. That detail, perhaps an insignificant one, but one that they ferret out, emphasize, evaluate, that trifle turns me inside out, guts sprawling; it is thus that <i>they</i> see that "I" am in the process of becoming an other at the expense of my own death (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 03)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

No, as in true theater, without makeup or masks, refuse and corpses <i>show me</i> that I permanently thrust aside in order to live. These body fluids, this defilement, this shit are what life withstands, hardly and with difficulty, on the part of death. There, I am at the border of my condition as a living being. My body extricates itself, as being alive, from that border (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 03)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

It is thus not lack of cleanliness or health that causes abjection but what disturbs identity, system, order. What does not respect borders, positions, rules. The in-between, the ambiguous, the composite (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 04)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

If it be true that the abkect simultaneously beseeches and pulverizes the subject, one can understand that it is experienced at the peak of its strenght when that subject,, weary of fruitless attempts to identify with something on the outside, finds the impossible within; whet it finds that the impossible constitutes its very <i>being</i>, that it <i>is</i> none other than abject (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 05)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Essentially different from "uncanniness", more violent, too, abjection is elaborated through a failure to recognize its kin; nothing is familiar, not even the shadow of a memory (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 05)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Yet, facing the ab-ject and more specifically phobia and the splitting of the ego (a point I shall return to), one might ask if those articulations of negativity germane to the uncounscious (inherited by Freud from philosophy and psichology) have not become inoperative. The "uncounscious" contents remaisn here <i>excluded</i> but in strange fashion: nor redically enough to allow for a secure differentiation between subject and object, and yet clearly enough for a defensive <i>position</i>  to be established -- one that implies a refusal but also a sublimation elaboration (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 07)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Owing to the ambiguous opposition I/Other, Inside/Outside -- an opposition that is vigorous but perviuous, violent but uncertain -- there are contents, "normally" uncounscious in neurotics, that become explicit if not conscious in "borderline" patients' speeches and behavior (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 07)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Since they make the conscious/uncounscious distinction irrelevant, borderline subjects and their speech constitute propitious ground for a sublimating  discourse ("aesthetic" or "mystical", etc.), rather than a scientific or rationalist one (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 07)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Situationist in a sense, and not without laughter -- since laughing is a way of placing or displacing abjection (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 08)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Instead of sounding himself as to his "being", he does so concerning his place: "<i>Where</i> am I?" instead of "<i>Who</i> am I?". For the space that engrosses the deject, the excluded, is never <i>one</i>, nor <i>homogeneous</i>, nor <i>totalizable</i>, but essentially divisible, foldable, anc catastrophic (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 08)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

For it is out of such straying on excluded ground that he draws his jouissance. The abkect from which he does not cease separating is for him, in short, a <i>land of oblivion</i> that is constantly remembered. Once upon blotted-out time, the abject must have been a magnetized pole of covetousness. But the ashes of oblivion now serve as a screen and reflect aversion, repugnance (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 08)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Jouissance, in short. For the stray considers himself as equivalent to a Third Party. He secures the latter's judgment, he acts on the strength of its power in order to condemn, he grounds himself on its law to tear the veil of oblivion but also to set up its object as inoperative. As jettisoned. Parachuted by the Other (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 09)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

For, having provided itself with an <i>alter ego</i>, the Other no longer has a grip on the three apices of the triangle where subjective homogeneity resides; and so, it jettisons the object into an abominable real, inaccessible except through jouissance. It follows that jouissance alone causes the abject to exist as such (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 09)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Hence a jouissance in which the subject is swallowed up but in which the Other, in return, keeps the subject from foundering by making it  repugnant (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 09)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

To be sure, if I am affected by wht does not yet appear to me as a thing, it is because laws, connections, and even structures of meaning govern and condition me. That order, that glance, that voice, that gesture, which enact the law for my frightened body, constitute and bring about an effect and not yet a sign (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 10)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

I experience abjection only if an Other has settled in place and stead of what will be "me". Not at all an other with whom I identify and incorporate, but an Other who precedes and possesses me, and through such possession causes me to be (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 10)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

There is an effervescence of object and sign -- not of desire but of intolerable significance; they tumble over into non-sense or the impossible real, but they appear even so in spite of "myself" (which is not) an abjection (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 11)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

If the abject is already a wellspring of sign for a non-object, on the edges of primal repression, one can understand its skirting the somatic symptom on the one hand and sublimation on the other (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 11)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

In the symptom, the abject permeates me, I become abject. Through sublimation, I keep it under control. The abject is edged with the sublime. It is not the same moment on the journey, but the same subject and speech bring them into being (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 11)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

For the sublime has no object either. When the starry sky, a vista of open seas or a stained glass window shedding purple beams fascinate me, there is a cluster of meaning, of colors, of word, os caresses, there are light touches, scents, sighs, cadences that arise, shroud me, carry me away, and sweep me beyond the things that I see, her, of think (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 12)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

/Not at all short but always with and through perception and words, the sublime is a <i>something added</i> that expands us, overstrain us, and causes us to be both <i>here</i>, as dejects, and <i>there</i>, as others and sparkling (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 12)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

The abject is that pseudo-object that is made up <i>before</i> but appears only <i>within</i> the gaps of secondary repression (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 12)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

The abject confronts us, on the one hand, with those fragile states where man strays on the territories of <i>animal</i> (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 12)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

The abject confronts us, on the other hand, and this time within our personal archeology, with our earliest attempts to release the hold of <i>maternal</i> entity even before ex-isting outside of her, thanks to the autonomy of language (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 13)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

In this struggle, which fashions the human being, the <i>mimesis</i>, by means of which he becomes homologous to another in order to become himself, is in short logically and chronologically secondary. Even before being <i>linke</i>, "I" am not but do <i>separate</i>, <i>reject</i>, <i>abject</i>. Abjection, with a meaning broadened to take in subjective diachrony, <i>is a precondition of narcissism</i> (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 13)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

But desire ex-patriates the <i>ego</i> toward an <i>other</i> subject and accepts the exactness of the ego only as narcissistic. Narcissism then appears as a regression to a position set back from the other, a return to a self-contemplative, conservative, self-sufficient haven (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 14)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

In both instances, the abject appears in order to uphold "I" within the Other. The abject is the violence of mourning for an "object" that has always already been lost. The abject shatters the wall of repression and its judgements. It takes the ego back to its source on broken away -- it assigns it a source in the non-ego, drive, and death (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 15)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

The abject is related to perversion (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 15)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

The abject is perverse because it neither gives up nor assumes a prohibition, a rule, or a law; but turns them aside, mislead, corrupts; uses them, takes advantage of them, the better to deny them. It kills in the name of life -- a progressive despot; is lives at the behest of death -- an operator in genetic experimentations; it curbs the other's suffering for its own profit -- a cynic (and a psychoan-/alist; it establishes narcissistic power while pretending to reveal the abyss -- an artist who practicecs his art as a "business" (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 15-16)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

An unshakable adherence to Prohibition and Law is necessart if that perverse interspace os abjection is to be hemmed in and thrust aside. Religion, Morality, Law (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 16)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

The writed, fascinated by the abject, imagines its logic, projects himself into it, introjects it, and as a consequence perverts language -- style and content. But on the other hand, as the sense of abjection, is both the abject's judge and accomplice, this is also true of the literature that confronts it (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 16)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Death would thus be the chief curator of our imaginary museum; it would protect us in the last resort from the abjection that contemporary literature claims to expend while uttering it (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 16)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Abjection accompanies all religious structurings and reappers, to be worked out in a new guise, at the time of their collapse (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 17)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Abjection persists as <i>exclusion</i> or taboo (dietary or other) in monotheistic religions, Judaism in particular, but drifts over to more "secondary" forms such as <i>transgression</i> (of the Law) within the same monotheistic economy. It finally encounters, with Christian sin, a dialectic elaboration, as it becomes integrated in the Christian Word as a threatening otherness -- but always nameable, alwayus totalizeable (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 17)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

In the contemporary practice of the West and owing to the crisis in Christianity, abjection elicits more archaic resonances that are culturally prior to sin; through them it again assumes / its biblical status, and beyond it that of defilement in primitive societies (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 17-18)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Through that experience, which is nevertheless managed by the Other, "subject" and "object" push each other away, confront each other, collapse, and star again -- inseparable, contaminated, condemned, at the boundary of what is assimilable, thinkable: abject (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 18)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Purification is comething only the Logos is capable of. But is that to be done in the manner of the <i>Phaedo</i>, stoically separating oneself from a body whose substance and passions are sources of impurity? Or rather, as in the <i>Sophist</i>, after having sorted out the worst from the best; or after the fashion of the <i>Philebus</i> by leaving the doors wide open to impurity, provided the eyes of the mind remain focused on truth? In such a case, pleasure, having become pure and true through the harmony of color and form as in the case of accurate and beautiful geometric form, has nothing in common, as the philosopher says, with "the pleasures of scratching" (<i>Philebus</i> 51) (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 27)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Aristotelian catharsis is closer to sacred incantation. It is the one that has bequeathed its name to the common, esthetic concept of catharsis. Through the mimesis of passions -- ranging from enthusiams to suffering -- in "language with pleasurable accessories", the most important of which being <i>rhythm</i> and <i>song</i> (see the <i>Poetics</i>, the soul reaches <i>orgy</i> and <i>purity</i> at the same time (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 28)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

To Platonic <i>death</i>, which owned, so to speak, the state of purity, Aristotle opposed the act of <i>poetic purification</i> -- in itself an impure process that protects from the abject only by dint of being immersed in it. The abject, mimed through sound and meaning, is <i>repeated</i>. Getting read of it is out of the question -- the final Platonic lesson has been undestood, one does not get rid of impure; one can, however, bring it into being a second time, and differently from the original impurity. It is a repetition through rhythm and song, therefore through what is not yet, or no longer is "meaning", bur arranges, defers, differentiates and organizes, harmonizes poathos, bile, warmth, and enthusiasm (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 28)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Poetic catharsis, which for more than two thousand years behaved as an underage sister of philosophy, face to face and incompatible with it, takes us away from purity, hence from Kantian ethics, which has long governed modern codes and remains more faithful to a certain platonic stoicism. By means of the "universalizing of maxims", as is well known, the Kant of the <i>Foundations of the Metaphysics of Ethics</i> or of the <i>Metaphysical principles of Virtue</i> advocated an "ethical gymnastics" in order to give us, by means of consciousness, control over  our defilements and, through that very consciousness, making us free and joyous (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 29)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

<i>Fear</i>, therefore, in a first sense, could be the <i>upsetting</i> of a bio-drive balance (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 33)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

So eager is he to name everything that he runs into the unnamable -- street sounds, that ceaseless trade activity involving horses in front of the house, the intensity with which his father, a recent convert to psychoanalysis, is interested in his body, his love for small girls, the stories and fantasies that he (the father) sexualizes to the utmost; the somewhat elusive, somewhat frail presence of his mother (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 34)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Metaphor of want as such, phobia bears the marks of the frailty of the subject's signifying system. It must be perceived that such a metaphor is inscribed not in verbhal rhetoric but in the heterogeneity of the psychic system that is made up of drive presentations <i>and</i>thing presentations linked to word presentations (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 35)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

On the other hand, taking the metaphoricalness into account would amount to considering the phobic person as a subject in want opf metaphoricalness (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 37)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

One might then view writing, or ar in general, not as the only treatment bus as the only "know-how" where phobia is / concerned (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 37-38)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

The one who tried to utter this "not yet a place", this no-grounds, can obviously only do so backwards, starting from an over-mastery of the linguistic and rhetorical code. But in the last analysis he refers to fear -- a terrifying, abject referent. We encounter this discourse in out dreams, or when death brushes us by, depriving us of the assurance mechanical use o f speech ordinarily gives changeable, immortal. But the writer is permanently confronted with such a language. The writer is a phobic who succeeds in mataphorizing in order to keep from being frightened to death; instead he comes to life again in signs (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 38)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Let me say then that <i>want</i> and <i>aggressivity</i> are chronologically separable but logically coextensive. Aggressivity <i>appears</i> to us as a rejoinder to the original deprivation felt from the time of the mirage known as "primary narcissism"; it merely takes revenge on initial frustrations. But what can be <i>known</i> of their connections is that want and aggressivity are adapted to one another. To speak of want alone ios to repudiate aggressivity in obsessional fashion; to speak of aggressivity alone, forgetting want, amounts to making transference paranoidal (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 39)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

In the face of this second threat, a completely symbolic one, I attempt another procedure: I am not the one that devours, I am being devoured by him; a third person therefore (he, a third person) is devouring me (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 39)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

I should point out here that the logic of the constitution of the phobic object also requires such a procesure of passivation (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 39)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

The phobic object is a complex elaboration, already comprising logical and linguistic workings that <i>are</i> attempts at drive introjection outlining the failure to introject that which is incorporated (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 40)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

It turns out that, under the circumstances, oral activity, which produces the linguistic signifier, coincides with the theme of devouring, which the "dog" metaphor has a first claim on (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 41)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

It happens because language has then become a conterphobic object; it no longer plays the role of an elemente of miscarried introjection, capable in the child's phobia, of revealing the anghish of original want (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 41)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Such a narcissism presents us with at least two problems. How can one account for its strength, which hands over the object drive? How does it happen that, dominating as it may be, it does not lead to autism? (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 42)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Since it is not sex-oriented, it denies the question of sexual difference; the subject that houses it can produce homosexual symptoms while being strictly speaking indifferent to them; that is not where the subject is (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 45)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Contrary to hysteria, which brings about, ignores, or seduces the symbolic but does not produce it, the subject of abjection is eminently productive of culture. its symptom is the rejection and recontruction of languages (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 45)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Voyeurism is a structural necessity in the constitution of object relation, showing up every time the object shifts toward the abject; it becomes true perversion only if there is a failure to symbolize the subject/object instability. Voyeurism accompanies the writing of abjection. When that writing stops, voyeurism becomes a perversion (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 46)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

But one soon realizes, during transference, that desire, if it dawns, is only a substitute for adaptation to a social norm (is desire ever enything else but desire for an idealized norm, the norm of the Other?) (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 47)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

The body's inside, in that case, shows up in order to compensate for the collapse of the border between inside and outside. It is as if the skin, a fragile container, no longer guaranteed the integrity of one's "own and clean self" but, scraped of transparent, invisible or taut, gave way before the dejection of its contents. Urine, blood, sperm, excrement then shows up in order to reassure a subject that is lacking its "own and clean self". The abjection of those flows from within suddenly become the sole "object" of sexual desire -- a true "ab-ject" where man, frightened, crosses over the horrors of maternal bowels and, in an immersion that enables him to avoid coming face to face with an other, spares himself the risk of castration (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 53)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

When a woman ventures out in those regions it is usually to gratify, in very maternal fashion, the desire for the abject that insures the life (that is, the sexual life) of the man whose symbolic authority she accepts. Very logically, this is an abjection from which she is frequently absent; she does not think about it, preoccupied as she is with settling accounts (obviously anal) with her own mother. Rarely does a woman tie her desire and her sexual life to that abjection, which, coming to her from the other, anchors her interiorly in the Other (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 54)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

This erotic cult of the abject makes one think of a perversion, but it must be distinguished at oncec from what simply dodges castration (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 55)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

The erotizatyion of abjection, and perhaps any abjection to the extent that it is already eroticized, is an attempt at stopping the hemorrhage: a threshold before death, a halt or a respite? (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 55)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

In psychoanalysis as in anthropology one commonly links the sacred and the establishment of the religious bond that is pressuposes with <i>sacrifice</i> (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 56)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

We are all familiar with that Freudian thesis as to the murder of the father and, more specifically, with the one he develops in <i>Moses and Monotheism</i>: in connection with Judaic religion the archaic father and master of the primeval horde is killed by the conspiring sons who, later seized with a sense of guilt for an act that was upon the whole inspired by ambivalent feelings, end up restoring paternal authority, no longer as an arbitrary power but as a right; thus renouncing the possession of all women in their turn, they establish at one stroke the sacred, exogamy, and society (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 56)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

That such a murderous event could be as much mythical as endowed with founding properties, that it should be both the keystone to the desire henceforth known as Oedipal and a severance that sets up a signifier admitting of logical concatenation, analytic attention now knows only too well (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 57)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Could the sacred be, whatever its variants, a two sided formation? One aspect founded by murder and the ocial bond made up of murder's guilt-ridden atonement, with all the pro- / jective mechanisms and obsessive rituals that accopmpany it; and another aspect, like a liging, more secret still and invisible, non-representable, oriented toward those uncertain spaces of unstable identity, toward the fragility -- both threatening and fusional -- of the archaic dyad, toward the non-separation of subject/object, on which language has no hold but one woven of fright and repulsion? (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 57-58)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Lévi-Strauss' structural anthropology has shown how all systems of knowledge in so-called primitive societies, and myths in particular, are a later elaboration, within stages of symbolicity, of the prohibition that weighs on incest and founds the signifying function as well as the social aggregate (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 58)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

He first appears to refer states of fear and impurity to primary narcissism, a narcissism laden with hostility and which does not yet know its limits (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 60)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

There would be a "beggining" preceding the word (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 61)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

An outside in the image of the inside, made of pleasure and pain. The non-distinctiveness of inside and outside would thus be unnamable, a border passable in both directions by pleasure and pain (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 61)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

If the <i>murder</i> of the father is that historical event constituting the social code as such, that is, symbolic exchange and the exchange of women, its equivalent on the level of the subjective history of each individual is therefore the <i>advent of language</i>, which breaks with perviousness if not with the chaos that precedes it and sets up denomination as an exchange of linguistic signs (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 61)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Narcissism is predicated on the existence of the <i>ego</i> but not of an <i>external object</i>; we are faced with the strange correlation between an entity (the ego) and its converse (the object), which is nevertheless not yet constituted; with an "ego" in relation to a non-object (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 62)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

By stressing the inherence of language in the human state, by overestimating the object's / having been the slave of language since before his birth, one avoids noting the two moods, active and passive, according to which the subject is contituted in the signifier; by the same token one neglects the economy of narcissism in the elaboration and practice of the symbolic function (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 62-63)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

A whole facet of the sacred, true lining of the sacrificial, compulsive, and paranoid side of religions, assumes the task of warding off that danger. This is precisely where we encounter the rituals of defilement and their derivatives, which, based on the feeling of abjection and all converging on the maternal, attempt to symbolize the other threat to the subject: that of being swamped by the dual relationshiop, thereby risking the loos not of a part (castration) but of the totality of his living being. The function of these religious rituals is to ward off the subject's fear of his very own identity sinking irretrievably into the mother (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 64)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

The logic of prohibition, which founds the abject, has been outlined and made explicit by a number of anthropologists concerned with defilement and its sacred function in so-called primitive societies. And yet Georges Bataille remains the only one, to my knowledge, who has linked the production of the abject to <i>the weakness of that prohibition</i>, which, in other respects, necessarily constitutes each social order. He links abjection to "the inability to assume with sufficient strength the imperative act of excluding" (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 64)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Anthropologists, since Sir James George Frazer, W. Robertson Smith, Arnold van Gennep, and Alfred Reginald Radcliffe-brown, or Rudolf Steiner, have noted that secular "filth", which has become sacred "defilement", is the <i>excluded</i> on the basis of which religious prohibition is made up (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 65)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

The purification rite appears then as that essential ridge, which, prohibiting the filthy object, extracts it from the secular order and lines it at once with a sacred facet (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 65)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

As if the social being, coextensive with a "symbolic system", were always present to itself through its religious structures, which transfer its contradictions to the level of rituals. And yet, at a second stage of her thinking, Mary Douglas seems to fing in the human body the prototype of that translucid being constituted by society as symbolic system (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 66)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Henceforth she finds herself led to <i>semantic</i> problems: what is the <i>meaning</i> that such a border-element assumes in other psychological, economic, etc., systems? At this moment of her thinking there emerges a concern to integrate Freudian data as semantic values connected with the psychosomatic founctioning of the speaking subject (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 66)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Lévi-Strauss' structural anthropology had one advantage among others; it linked a classification system, that is, a symbolic system, within a given society, to the order of language in its universality (binary aspects of phonology, signifier-signified dependencies and autonomies, etc.) (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 66)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

One might advance the hypothesis that a (social) symbolic system <i>corresponds</i> to a specific structuration of the speaking subject in the <i>symbolic order</i>. To say that it "corresponds" leaves out questions of cause and effect; is the social determined by the subjective, or is it the other way around? (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 67)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Defilement, by means of the rituals that consecrate it, is perhaps, for a social aggregate, only one of the possible foundings of abjection bordering the frail identity of the speaking being (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 67)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

In this sense, abjection is coextensive with social and symbolic order, on the individual as well as on the collective level. By virtue of this, abjection, just like <i>prohibition of incest</i>, is a universal phenomenon; one encounters it as soon as the symbolic and/or social dimension of man is constituted, and this throughout the course of civilization (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 68)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Leaving aside the question of the priority of one over the other (the social does not represent the subjective any more than the subjective represents the social), I shall posit that they both follow the same logic, with no other goal than the survival of both group and subject (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 68)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

It inevitably entails a share of <i>disapointment</i> for the empirically minded ethnologist. It does not unfold without a share of <i>fiction</i>, the nucleus of which, drawn from actuality and the subjective experience of the one who writes, is projected upon data collected from the life of other cultures, less to justify itself than to throw light on them by means of an interpretation to which they obviously offer resistance (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 68)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

In the first place, filth is not a quality in itself, but it applies only to what relates to a <i>boundary</i> and, more particularly, represents the object jettisoned out of that boundary, its other side, a margin (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 69)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Finally, even if human beings are involved with it, the dangers entailed by defilement are not within their power to deal with but depend on a power "inhering in the structure of ideas". Let us posit that defilement is an objective evil undergone by the subject. Or, to put it another way, the danger of filth represents for the subject the risk to which the very symbolic order is permanently exposed, to the extent tyhat it is a device of discriminations, of differences (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 69)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Why does <i>corporeal waste</i>, menstrual blood and excrement, or everything that is assimilated to them, from nail-parings to decay, represent -- like a metaphor that would have become incarnate -- the objective frailty of symbolic order? (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 70)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

In societies where it occurs, ritualization of defilment is accompanied by a strong concern for separating the sexes, and this means giving men rights over women. The latter, apparently put in the position of passive objects, are non the less felt to be wily powers, "baleful schemers" from whom rightful beneficiaries must protect themselves. It is as if, lacking a central authoritarian power that would settle the definitive supremacy of one sex -- or lacking a legal establishment that would balance the prerogatives of both sexes -- two powers attempted to share out society. One of them, the masculine, apparently victkorious, confesses through its very relentlessness against the other, the feminine, that it is threatened by an asymmetrical, irrational, wily, uncontrollable power. Is this a survival of a matrilineal society or the specific particularity of a structure (wiithout the incidence of diachrony)? The wuestion of the origins of such a handling of sexual difference remains moot. But whether it be within the highly hierarchical society of India or the Lele in Africa it is always to be noticed that the attempt to establish a male, phallic power is vigorously threatened by the no less virulent power of the other sex, which is oppressed (recently? or not sufficiently for the survival needs of society?). That other sex, the feminine, becomes synonymous with a radical evil that is to be suppressed (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 70)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

While they always relate to corporeal orificees as to so many landmarks parceling-constituting the body's territory, polluting objects fall, schematically, into two types: excremental and menstrual. Neither tears nor sperm, for instance, although they belong to borders of the body, have any polluting value (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 71)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Menstrual blood, on the contrary, stands for the danger issuing from ithin the identity (social or sexual); it threatens the relationship between the sexes within a social aggregate and, through internalization, the identity of each sex in the face of sexual difference (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 71)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

That goes without saying where menstrual blood signifies sexual difference. But what about excrement? It will be remembered that the anal penis is also the phallus with which infantile imagination provides the feminine sex and that, on the other hand, maternal authority is experienced first and above all, after the first essentially oral frustrations, as sphincteral training (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 71)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

It is a "binary logic", a primal mapping of tthe body that I call semiotic to say that, while being the precondition of language, it is dependent upon meaning, but in a way that is not that of <i>linguistic</i> signs nor of the <i>symbolic</i> order they found. Maternal authority is the trustee of that mapping of the self's clean and proper body; it is distinguished from paternal lawa within which, with the phallic phase and acquisition of language, the destiny of man will take shape (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 72)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Basic symbolic institutions, such as <i>sacrifice</i> or <i>myths</i>, expand on logical processes inherent in the economy of language itself; in doing so they realize for the community what makes up in depth, historically and logically, the speaking being as such (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 72)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Following that line, one could suggest that the rites surrounding defilement, particularly those involving excremential and menstrual variants, shift the <i>border</i> (in the psychoanalytic meaning relating to borderline patients) that separates the body's territory from the signifying chain; they illustrate the boundary between semiotic authority and symbolic law (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 73)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

As if purification rites, through a language that is already there, looked back toward an archaic experience and obtained from it a partial-object, not as such but only as a <i>spoor</i> of a pre-object, an archaic parceling. By menas of the symbolic institution of ritual, that is to say, by means of a system of ritual exclusions, the partial-object consequently becomes <i>scription</i> -- an inscription of limits, an emphasis placed not on the (paternal) Law but on (maternal) Authority through the very signifying order (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 73)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

First, those rites concerning defilement (but perhaps also any rite, defilement rite being prototypical) effect an abreaction of the pre-sign impact, the semiotic impact of language (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 73)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

In the second place, the strong ritualization of defilement, which may be observed, for instance, within the castes of India, appears to be accompanied by one's being totally blind to filth itself, even though it is the object of those rites (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 74)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

That may be because setting up the rite of defilement takes on the function of the hyphen, the virgule, allowing the two universes of <i>filth</i> and of <i>prohibition</i> to brush lightly against each other without necessarily being identified as such, as <i>object</i> and as <i>law</i> (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 74)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

One might ask, proceeding in reverse, if all writing is not a second level rite, at the level of language, that is, which causes one to be reminded, through the linguistic signs themselves, of the demarcations that pre-condition them and go beyond them. Indeed, writing causes the subject who ventures in it to confront an archaic authority, on the nether side of the proper Name. The maternal connocations of this authority never escaped great writers, no more than the coming face to face with what we have called abjection (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 75)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Food becomes abject only if it is a border between two distinct entities or territories. A boundary between nature and culture, between the human and the non-human (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 75)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

The fact remains nevertheless that all food is liable to defile (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 75)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

That ambivalence of residues (pollution <i>and</i> potential for renewal, remainder and fesh start) can also be seen in domains unrelated to food. Some cosmogonies represent the remainder, after the flood, in the shape of a serpent that becomes the supporter of Vishnu and thus insures the rebirth of the universe. In similar fashion, if what remains of a sacrifice can be called abject, in another connection consuming the leavings of a sacrifice can also be the cause of a series of good rebirths and can even lead to finding salvation (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 76)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

In its view there is nothing that is everything; nothing is exhaustive, there is a residue in every system -- in cosmogony, food ritual, and even sacrifice, which deposits, through ashes for instance, ambivalent remains. A challenge to our mono-theistic and mono-logical universes such a mode of thinking apparently needs the ambivalence of remainder if it is not to become enclosed within <i>One</i> single-level symbolics, and thus always posit a non-object as polluting as it is reviving -- defilement and genesis (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 76)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Fear of the archaic mother turns out to be essentially fear of her generative power. It is this power, a dreaded one, that patrilineal filiation has the burden of subduing (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 77)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Thus, in a society where religious prohibitions correspond to the sexual prohibitions intended to separate men from women and insure the power of the former over the latter, it has been possible to note -- as with the Gidjingali in Australia -- the considerable sway of maternal authority over the sons. On the other hand, with the neighboring Aranda, where paternal control is mush more important than with the Gidjingali, there is no connection between sexual and religious prohibitions (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 77)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Menstrual pollution, as well as prohibition of incecst with the mother, considerer the most dangerous of all, can be interpreted as the symbolic equivalent of that conflict (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 77)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Here is a significant fact. Again as a protection against the generative power of women, pollution rites arise within societies that are afraid of overpopulation (in barren regions, for instance). One thus finds them, as part of a whole system of restraining procreation, along with incest taboo, etc., among the Enga of New Guinea (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 78)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Such a relaxation of prohibitions among the Fore, for the sake of a single objective -- reproduction at any cost -- is accompanied by such a lack of the "clean and propoer" and hence of the "abject" that cannibalism of the dead seems to be current practice (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 78)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Dumont concludes that the endogamy in castes is only a consequence of the initial hierarchic principle based on the opposition pure/impure (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 79)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Starting from there, the question as to whether the pure/impure opposition determines the hierarchic order, or whether caste endogamy is the initial principle, appears in a different light (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 79)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Let me note only that in an organization like this one, without classic exogamy, social order is not elab- / orated on the basis of clear-cut oppositions represented by <i>men</i> and <i>women</i> as tokens of "one's own" and the "foreign", the "same" and the "different" (sex, group, clan, etc.). Nevertheless, as though making up for that lack of differentiation, meticulous rules of separation, rejection, and repulsion are introduced (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 79-80)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

That very particular search for a father having a higher status is interpreted as maintaining "matrilineal filiation in a patrilineal environment" (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 80)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

I shall simply conclude that the hierarchic principle is jointly based on two logical principles -- the separation exemplified by the dichotomy of the pure and the impure, and the <i>maintaining of balance</i> between the two sexes through endogamy (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 81)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Particularly, he dwells on the question of "food loathing": is carte a "matter of marriega" or a "matter of meals"? (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 81)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

One is then led to conceive of the opposition between pure and impure not as an archetype but as <i>one</i> coding of the differentiation of the speaking subject as such, a coding of his repulsion in relation to the other in order to autonomize himself. The pure/impure opposition represents (when it does not function as mataphor) the striving for identity, a difference. It appears instead of <i>sexual difference</i> (and in that sence it may seem, as in caste system, parallel to the institutionalizing of bisexuality through endogamic marriage). On that basis, it acts as a <i>separating value</i> peculiar to the symbolic function itself (sacrificer/sacrifice/God; subject/thing/meaning) (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 82)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

In the final analysis, the pure/impure opposition would not be a datum in itself but would stem from the necessity for the speaking being to be confronted with sexual difference and the symbolic (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 82)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

If it be true that the pure/impure opposition takes in the area that, with us, is governed by the good/evil opposition, the boundary at issue is related, through the hierarchy of caste and matrimonial regulations that accompany and secure it, to a very deep logic of the speaking being as separated by sex and language (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 83)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

A sovereign on account of his <i>knowing</i> how to unveil logical enigmas, Oedipus the king is nonetheless ignorant of his desire. He <i>does not know</i> that he is also the one who kills his father Laius and marries his mother Jocasta. Had they remained veiled, that murder as much as that desire would only be obverse, quite obviously solidarity, of his logical and consequently political power. Abjection breaks out only when, drive to distraction by a desire to know, Oedipus discovers desire and death / in his sovereign being; when he assigns them to the same, full, knowing, and responsible sovereignty (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 83-84)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

If it be true that such blinding is equivalent to castration, it is neither eviration nor death. In relation to them, it is a symbolic substitute intended for building the wall, reinforcing the boundary that wards off opprobrium, which, because of this very fact, is not disavowed but shown to be alien (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 84)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

His abjection is due to the permanent ambiguity of the parts he plays without his knowledge, even when he believes he knows (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 84)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

If such is the logic of Oedipus as <i>pharmakos</i>, <i>katharmos</i>, there is no alternative but to note that Sophocles' play derives its effectiveness not only from that mathesis of ambiguity but also from the wholly semantic values it endows opposing terms with. But what values? (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 85)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Defilement blends into it: practically, it amounts to tampering with the mother. Defilement is incest considered as transgression of the boundaries of what is clean and proper (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 85)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

The replica of Oedipus-<i>pharmakos</i> on the woman's side is Jocasta; she is herself Janus-like, ambiguity and reversal in a single being, a single part, a single function. Janus-like perhaps as any woman is, to the extent that any woman is at the same time a desiring being, that is, a speaking being, and a reproductive being, that is, one that separates itself from its child (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 85)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Neither a confession of guilt nor an entreaty of innocence consequent to the suffering that was undergone, that statement marks the slipping before Oedipus the king to Oedipus the subject (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 87)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

For it is on foreign soil, and to a foreign hero, Theseus, a symbolic son, that he bequeaths, at the same time as his daughters, the secret of his death. A death that, also in and of itself, without being in any way expiatory or redeeming for Oedipus, is meant for the benefit of others, of foreigners -- Theseus and the Atheneans (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 87)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

At Colonus, therefore, the fate of abjection was changed. Neither excluded nor blindly other, it finds its place as his <i>not known</i> / within a "subject on the verge of death". Abjection is nothing more than a flaw in Oedipus' impossible sovereignity, a flaw in his knowledge. If rituals are called upon to purify it, it is nevertheless in the <i>sayings</i> of Oedipus concerning divine Law as well as Theseus that it is assumed (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 88)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

A bridge has been built toward another logic of abjection: it is no longer defilement to be excluded ritually as the other facet of the sacred (social, cultural, one's own) but <i>transgression</i> due to a <i>misreading</i> of the Law (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 88)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

The border between abjection and the sacred, between desire and knowledge, between death and society, can be faced squarely, uttered without sham innocence or modest self-effacement, provided one sees in it an incidence of man's particularity as <i>mortal and speaking</i> (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 88)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Interpretations of biblical impurity are, roughly speaking, divided along two lines of persuasion. The first, following up on the ideas of W. Robertson Smith (<i>The Religion of the Semites</i> 1889), considers biblical impurity as a condition internal to Jewish monotheism, intrinsically dependent on divine will, since the impure is what departs from divine precepts. Far from being a demonic force alien to diviniti, impurity would then be a kind of <i>neutralization of taboos</i> (peculiar to rites of defilement), owing to the fact that it is subordinate to the will of God (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 90)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

I shall try to demonstrate that those two contrary positions, in fact, do no more than unilaterally emphasize the complex dynamics of biblical thought concerning impurity (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 90)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

But the biblical test -- and therein lies its extraordinary specificity -- performs the tremendous forcing that consists in subordinating maternal power (whether historical or phantamatic, natural or reproductive) to sym bolic order as pure logical order regulating social performance, as  divine Law attended to in the Temple (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 91)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

If, on the other hand, one tries to go back further into the archeology of that impurity, one indeed encounters fear in the face of a power (maternal? natural? -- at any rate insubordinate and not liable of being subordinated to Law) that <i>might</i> become autonomous evil but <i>is not</i>, so long as the hold of subjective and social symbolic order endures (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 91)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

When Mary Douglas defines impurity as that which <i>departs</i> from <i>symbolic order</i> and Neusner sees in it what is <i>incompatible with the Temple</i>, they are talking about the same thing according / to <i>two points of view</i> (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 91-92)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

But the question for the analyst-semiologist is to know how far one can analyze ritual impurity. The historian of religions stops soon: the cultically impure is that which is based on a natural "loathing". The anthropologist goes further: there is nothing "loathsome" in itself; the loathsome is that which disobeys classification rules peculiar to the given symbolic system (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 92)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

The pure/impure distinction, <i>tahor/tame</i>, shows up in the biblical episode of Noah's burnt offerings to the Lord after the flood. "And Noah builded an altar unto the Lord; and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar. That recognition of the pure/impure difference apparently forces the Lord to defer his judgement -- and that entails <i>clemency</i> on the one hand, <i>time</i> on the other (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 92)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

One can observe, however, along the complex course followed by Yahwist and Elohist, how that fundamental difference in fact subsumes the others -- life and death, vegetal and animal, flesh and blood, hale and ill, otherness and incest. Keeping to the semantic value of those oppositions, one can group them under three major categories of abomination: 1) food taboos; 2) corporeal alteration and its climax, death; and 3) the feminine body and incest. Topologically speaking such variants correspond to one's being allowed to have access or not to a place -- the holy place of the Temple (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 93)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Commentators have noted that if biblical impurity is from the outset tied to the religious cult since the impure is that which is excluded from the Temple, it deals with matter (food, menses, leprosy, gonorrhea, etc.) having no immediate relation to the sacred place (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 93)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Nevertheless, and without for that matter undergoing any great change, it now appears even more allegorical or metaphorical, for henceforth there is less stress on the cultic center of purity than on impurity, which has become a metaphor for idolatry, sexuality, and immorality (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 93)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

I shall try to demonstrate that there is no opposition between material abomination and topo-logical (holy place of the Temple) or logical (holy Law) reference. The one and the other are two aspects, semantic and logical, of the imposition of a <i>strategy of identity</i>, which is, in all stricness, that of monotheism (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 94)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

I shall posit that the "material" semes of the pure/impure opposition that mark out the biblical text are not metaphors of the divine prohibition resuming archaic, material customs, but are responses of symbolic Law, in the sphere of subjective economy and the genesis of speaking identity (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 94)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

As to sacrifice, it constitutes the alliance with the One when the metonymic order that stems from it is perturbed. Sacrificec thus operates between two heterogeneous, incompatible, forever irreconcilable terms. It connects them necessarily in violent fashion, violating at the same time as it posits in the semantic isotopy of each. Sacrifice is thus a <i>metaphor</i> (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 95)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

It seems to me more tenable to say that some collections of religious texts, by stressing taboo, seek protection from sacrificial interference or at least subordinate the latter to the former. Biblical abomination would thus be an attempt to throttle murder. Through sustained abomination, Judaism parts ways with sacrificial religions (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 95)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

With biblical abomination religion is probably wending its way toward fulfillment (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 95)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

From its very beginning, the biblical text insists on maintaining the distance between man and God by means of a dietary diferentiation. Thus the Lord (Genesis 3:22), after noting that "mas is become as one of us, to know good and evil", decides to prevent this pretentious "scholar" from also becoming immortal. He thus prohibits certain foods by banishing him from the garden of Eden, "lest he put forth his hand, and take also from the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever" (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 95)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

One should note / that it is a feminine and animal temptation that is concealed under the first dietary trespass; for we shall encounter the reference to woman only fortuitously in the later abominations of the Levites (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 95-96)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

It is indeed only <i>after the Flood</i> that authorization is granted to eat "every moving thing that liveth" (Genesis 9:3). Far from being a reward, such permission is acoompanied by an acknowledgement of essential evil, and it includes a negative, incriminating connotation with respect to man: "For the imagination of man's heart is evil" (Genesis 8:21) (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 96)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

In the postdiluvian situation such a distinction is brought out again under the guise of the flesh/blood opposition. On the one hand there is bloodless flesh (destined for man) and on the other, blood (destined for God). Blood, indicating the impure, takes on the "animal" seme of the previous opposition and inherits the propensity for muder of which man must cleanse himself. But blood, as a vital element, also refers to women, fertility, and the assurance of fecundation. It thus becomes a fascinating semantic crossroads, the propitious place for abjection where <i>death</i> and <i>femininity</i>, <i>murder</i> and <i>procreation</i>, <i>cessation of life</i> and <i>vitality</i> all come together. "But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat" (Genesis 9:4) (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 96)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

The dietary domain will then continue to be the privileged object of divine taboos, but it will be modified, amplified, and even seem to become identified with the most moral, if not the most abstract, statements of the Law (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 97)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Two officiants at the sacrifice, having "offered strange fire" to the Lord Yahweh, become "devoured" by the sacred fire (Leviticus, 10:1-2). At that moment, a communication from the Lord seems to indicate that the sacrifice "in itself" cannot assume the status of a divine covenant, unless that sacrifice is <i>already</i> inscribed in a logic of the pure/impure distinction, which it would consolidate and enable one to hand down (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 97)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

The sacrifice has efficacy then only when manifesting a logic of separation, distinction, and difference that is governed by admissibility to the holy place, that is, the appointed place for encountering the sacred fire of the Lord Yahweh (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 97)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

The pure will no longer be what is restricted to a <i>place</i> but what accords with a <i>speech</i>; the impure will not only be a fascinating <i>element</i> (connoting murder and life: blood) but any infraction to a <i>logical conformity</i> (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 98)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

The list of the occasionally specious prohibitions that make up this chapter becomes clear when it is understood that there is a strict intent of establishing conformity with the logical of the divine word. Now such a logic is founded on the initial biblical postulate of the man/God difference, which is coextensive with the prohibition of murder (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 98)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

One needs to preserve oneself from murder, not incorporate carnivorous or rapacious animals, and there is only one prescription for that: eating herbivorous, cud-chewing animals (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 98)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Thus, what initially appeared to us as a basic opposition between man and God (vegetable/animal, flesh/blood), following / upon the initial contract, "Thou shall not kill", becomes a complete system of logical oppositions. Differing from burnt offerings, this system of abomination presupposes it and guarantees its efficacy (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 98-99)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

If she gives birth to a daughter, the girl "shall be unclean two weeks, as in her separation" (Leviticus 12:5). To purify herself, the mother must provide a burnt offering and a sin offering. Thus, on <i>her</i> part, there is impurity, defilement, blood, and purifying sacrifice. On the other hand, if she gives birth to a male, "the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised" (Leviticus 12:3). Circumcision would thus separate one from maternal, feminine impurity and defilement; it stands instead of sacrifice, meaning not only that it replaces it but is its equivalent -- a sign of the alliance with God (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 99)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

The terms, impurity and defilement, that Leviticus heretofore had tied to doos that did not conform to the taxonomy of sacred Law, are now attributed to the mother and to women in general (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 100)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Might it be that dietary prohibitions are a screen in a still more radical separating process? Would the dispositions <i>place-body</i> and the more elaborate one <i>speech-logic of differences</i> be an attempt to keep a being who speaks to his God separated from the fecund mother? In that case, it would be a matter of separating oneself from the phastasmatic power of the mother, that archaic Mother Goddess who actually haunted the imagination of a nation at war with the surrounding polytheism. A phastasmatic mother who also constitutes, in the specific history of each person, the abyss that must be established as an autonomous (and not encroaching) <i>place</i> and <i>distinct</i> object, meaning a <i>signifiable</i> one, so that such a person might learn to speak (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 100)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Chapters 13 and 14 of Leviticus locate impurity in leprosy: skin tumor, impairment of the cover that guarantees corporeal integrity, sore on the visible, presentable surface. To bu sure, leprosy does objectively cause serious damage in a people with a strong community life and, moreover, an often nomadic one (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 101)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

From that point of view, the abomination of leprosy becomes inscribed within the logical conception of impurity to which I have already called attention: intermixture, erasing of differences, threat to identity (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 101)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

By means of what turnabout is the mother's interior associated with decay? I have already noted that turning among split subjects (see pp. 53-55). It is reasonable to assume that the biblical text, in its own way, accurately follows the path of an analogous fantasy. Evocation of the maternal body and childbirth induces the image of birth as a violent act of expulsion through which the nascent body tears itself away from the matter of maternal insides (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 101)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

The obsession of the leprous and decaying body would thus be the fantasy of a self-rebirth on the part of a subject who has not introjected his mother but has incorporated a devouring mother (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 102)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

The body must bear no trace of its debt to nature: it must be clean and proper in order to be fully symbolic. In oder to confirm that, it should endure no gash other than that of circumcision, equivalent to sexual separation and/or separation from the mother. Any other mark would be the sign of belonging to the impure, the non-separate, the non-symbolic, the non-holy (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 102)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

It takes in the following: prohibition of meat diet (following upon the prohibition against killing), the postdiluvian classification of meat as in conformity or nonconformity with the divine word, the principle of identity without admixture, the exclusion of anything that breaks boundaries (flow, drain, discharge). From food to blood, the loop of prohibitions has no need of being looped,, for we are still and from the beginning within the same logic of separation. But we are again led back to the fundamental semanticism of that logic, which persists in positing an agency that is <i>other</i> than that of the nutritious, the sanguine, in short, the "natural" maternal (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 103)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

For that purpose, intercourse between same and same will have to be prohibited -- neither promiscuity within families nor homosexuality. Nor can there be contact with another group as constituted by law (human or "natural", that is, always divine): no adultery, no zoophilia (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 103)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

The same condemnation of hybrids and migrant beings can probably be read in the prohibition against leavened bread and the recommendation that azyme be eaten on certain occasions in order to renew ties with the original food of the patriarchs; without the adding of leaven, the elements of such bread have only their own, proper qualities (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 103)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Henceforth, confronting the "future perfect" of a discourse that is One and transmitted, impurity moves away from the material register and is formulated as profanation of the divine name (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 104)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

But the recurrence of a specific trope should be noted; it embodies the asserted logic of separation, and in my view it points to the uncounscious foundation of such a persistence: "Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk" (Exodus 23:19, 34:26, Deuteronomy 14:21) (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 105)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

What is implicated is not milk as food but milk considered in its symbolic value. Abomination does not reside in nourishing but in seething, that is, <i>cooking</i> the young goat in its mother's milk; in other words, it amounts to using milk not in terms of a need for survival but according to a cultural culinary fancy, which sets up an abnormal bond between mother and child (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 105)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Thus, when we find in the <i>Midrash Tanhumah</i> the statement, "In this world I abhor all nations for they are issued of impure seed", the phrase "impure seed" should be understood as "incestuous" (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 105)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Abjection -- dietary, sanguine, and moral -- is pushed back within the chosen people, not because they are worse than others, but because in the light of the contract that they alone have entered into, abjection appears as such (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 107)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

The logical complicity, the economic inseparability of pure and impure in the Bible, become clear, if need be, thanks to the very word that, in Isaiah, indicates impurity: <i>t'bh, to'ebah</i>, an abominationthat is also a prohibition (1:13) (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 107)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Biblical impurity could be "a realized form of demoniacal forces" only to the extent that the prophetic leavin transformed the <i>dietary abomination</i> of earlier texts into an inseparable lining, an inherence in the contract or the symbolic condition. Such a demoniacal force (thus not at all autonomous but only intrinsic to and coiled within divine speech) is in fact the <i>impure</i>, from which the Temple and the separating divine Speech want to differentiate us, and which appears to the Prophets as non-rejectable, parallel, inseparable from the clean and proper and the identical (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 107)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Contrary to what enters the mouth and nourishes, what goes out of the body, out of its pores and openings, points to the infinitude of the body proper and gives rise to abjection (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 108)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Psychoanalysis has indeed seen that anal dejection contitute the first material separation that is controllable by the human being. It has also deciphered, in that very rejection, the mastered <i>repetition</i> of a more archaic separation (from the maternal body) as well as the condition of <i>division</i> (high-low), of discretion, of difference, of recurrence, in short the condition of the process that underpin symbolicity (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 108)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

A decaying body, lifeless, completely turned into dejection, blurred between the inanimate and the inorganic, a transitional swarming, inseparable lining of a human nature whose life is undistinguishable from the symbolic -- the corpse represents fundamental pollution. A body without soul, a non-body, disquieting matter, it is to be excluded from God's <i>territory</i> as it is from his <i>speech</i>. Without always being impure, the corpse is "accursed of God" (Deuteronomy 21:23): it must not be displayer but immediately buried so as not to pollute the divine earth (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 109)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Impure animals become even more impure once they are dead (Leviticus 11:24-40), contact with their carcasses must be avoided. The human corpse is a fount of impurity and must not be touched (Numbers 19:13ff). Burial is a means of purification (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 109)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Worshipping corpses on the one hand, eating objectionable meat on the other: those are the two abominations that bring about divine malediction and thus point to the two ends of the chain of prohibitions that binds the biblical text and entails, as I have suggested, a whole range of sexual or moral prohibitions (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 110)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

But one must stress what differentiates whose two currents beyond their similarity. The killed object, from which I am separated through sacrifice, while it links me to God it also set itself up, in the very act of being destroyed, as desirable, fascinating, and sacred. What has been killed subdues me and brings me into subjection to what has been sacrificed. To the / contrary, the abjected object from which I am separated through abomination, if it guarantees a pure and holy law, turns me aside, cuts me off, and throws me out. The abject tears me away from indifferentiated and brings me into subjection to a system. In short, the abominate is a response to the sacred, its exhaustion, its ending (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 110-111)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

A religion of abomination overlays a religion of the sacred. It marks the exit of religion and the unfolding of morals; or leading back the One that separates and unifies, not to the fascinated contemplation of the sacred, from which it separates, but to the very device that it ushers in: logic, abstraction, rules of systems and judgements. When the victim is changed into an abomination, a deep qualitative change takes place: the religion that ensues, even if it continues to harbor sacrifice, is no longer a sacrificial religion. It tempers the fascination of murder; it gets around its desire by means of the abomination it associates with any act of incorporation and rejection of an ob-ject, thing or living being (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 111)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Christ, far from being a scapegoat, indeed offers himself to a death-and-resurrection that causes sin to be visited on all members of the community and on each individually, instead of absolving them; it thus prepared them for a (phantasmatic?) society without violence (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 111)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Not only shall you not kill, but you shall not sacrifice anything without observing rules and prohibitions (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 112)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

The law, in order words what restrains the desire to kill, is a taxonomy. Even if it is only after the period of exile, and in place of earlier tribal rules, that homicide becomes the object of a <i>secred</i> law that changes murder into defilement for Israel and establishes rules for atonement, the very idea of homicide as an offense to God is present throughout the biblical text (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 112)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

The system of abominations sets in motion the persecuting machine in which I assume the place of the victim in order to justify the purification what will separate me from that place as it will from any other, from all others. Mother and death, both abominated, abjected, skyly build a victimizing and persecuting machine at the cost of which I become subject of the Symbolic as well as Other of the Abject (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 112)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

It is through abolishment of dietary taboos, partaking of food with pagans, verbal and gestural contact with lepers, as well as through its  power over impure spirits that the message of Christ is characterized and, as is well known, compels recognition in a most spectacular manner -- superficial perhaps but striking (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 113)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

An essential trait of those evangelical attitudes or narratives is that abjection is no longer exterior. It is permanent and comes from within. Threatening, it is not cut off but is reabsorbed into speech (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 113)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

That expedient is <i>oralization</i>, which the New Testament will try to rehabilitate, render guiltless, before inverting the pure/impure dichotomy into an outside/inside one (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 114)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Other instances give evidence that the emphasis in henceforth placed on the inside/outside boundary, and that the threat comes no longer from outside bur from within (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 114)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

It is thus an appeal to the recognition not so much of a Law as of concrete, genetic, and social authority -- a natural one, so to speak -- that leads to the interiorization of impurity. Through re-cognition of your parents, that which is external threat to you will appear as internal danger (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 115)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

It is as if the mother had to agree to "fill" her child, give her a privileged food, distinct from the "crumbs" for dogs, before the devil would go away and the woman open her heart to the words of Christ (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 115)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

As in analytic process, the reader of the New Testament is led, by elaborating on the archaic relation to his parents, particularly the oral relation to his mother, to introject the drive-quality attached to archaic objects. Now, without that introjection, pre-objects and abjects threaten from without as impurity, defilement, abomination, and eventually they trigger the persecutive apparatus (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 116)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

For evil, thus displaced <i>into</i> the subject, will not cease tormenting him from within, no longer as a polluting or defiling substance, but as the ineredicable repulsion of his henceforth divided and contradictory being (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 116)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Through the process of interiorization, defilement will blend with guilt, which already exists on a moral and symbolic level in the Bible (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 116)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Freud moreover stressed the point in <i>Moses and Monotheirm</i>, revealing that Christian religion is a compromise between paganism and Judaic monotheism (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 116)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

But this time that logic functions exclusively in the signifying universe of the speaking being, rent between two potentialities, demoniacal and divine. Maternal principle, reconciled with the subject, is not for that matter revalorized, rehabilitated. Of its nourishing as much as threatening heterogeneity, later texts, and even more so theological porterity, will keep only the idea of sinning flesh (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 117)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

the boundary between inside and outside (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 117)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

"Kill, and eat", says God to an astonished Peter at Joppa (Acts 10:9-16). But that permission, far from being a liberalization, will lead the subject who complies with it to seek no longer his defilement but the error within his own thoughts and speech (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 117)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

It is equally remarkable that Jesus' pronouncement concerning man's defilement by what <i>emanates</i> from him, rather than by what enters, is preceded and followed by two tales of multiplication of bread and fiches (Mark 6:38ff. and 8:14ff.). The word for "bread", <i>artos</i>, is repeated seventeen times in this section, as if to provide it with unity. Several lines of thought appear to converge on that article of multiplication. If there is, on the other hand, a concern for "satisfying" the hunger of the greatest possible number, it is, once again, to the spirit that the food seems destined, for Jesus does not cease calling upon understanding to decipher the meaning of his action (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 117)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Even more so, does not that multiplication of dietary objects also constitute (taking into account the inward displacement of emphasis) a sort of invitation to multiply, if not relativize, conscience itself? It is no longer one but polyvalent, as is the entirely parabolic, fictional meaning of the miracle (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 118)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

By surreptitiously mingling the theme of "devouring" with that of "satiating", that narrative is a way of taming cannibalism. It invites a removal of guilt from the archaic relation to the first pre-object (ab-ject) of need: the mother (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 118)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Through oral-dietary satisfaction, there emerges, beyond it, a lust for swallowing up the other, while the fear of impure nourishment is revealed as deathly drive to devour the other (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 118)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Body and spirit, nature and speech, divine nourishment, the body of Christ, assuming the guise of a natural food (bread), signifies me both as divided (flesh and spirit) and infinitely lapsing (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 118)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Henceforth reconciled with it, the Christian subject, completely absorbed into the symbolic, is no longer a being of abjection but a lapsing subject (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 119)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

A spiritualization of both the purity/impurity distinction and the inside/outside division of subjective space is thus effected. The <i>understanding</i> of the disciples is being appealed to, in order to have them comprehend that the outside of man cannot possibly defile him (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 119)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

And yet, if it is true that the notion of sin carried that spirituality far, it is nevertheless upon a body that its highest development rests: the body of Christ. Purifying, redeeming all sins, it punctually and temporarily gives back innocence by means of communion (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 119)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Thus one might say that if the inside/outside boundary is maintained, osmosis nevertheless takes place between the spiritual and the substantial, the corporeal and the signifying -- a heterogeneity that cannon be divided back into its components (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 120)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Sin then remains the only token of difference from the sublimity of Christ. In a universe where differences are resorbed through the effort of an ideal identification with the experience of Christ -- an impossible one from the very start -- sin, even if its remission is always promised, remains the rock where one endures the human condition as separate: body and spirit, body jettisoned from the spirit; as condition that is impossible, irreconcilable, and, by that very token, real (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 120)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Clearly Judaic in spirit, <i>debt</i> points to a ruthless creditor and / assigns the subject to the place of the debtor whose infinite payments will fill the distance that separates him from God only by means of a faith indefinitely maintained (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 121)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

On the level of debt and iniquity, even more so than that of impurity, sin is set forth as constitutive of man, coming to him from the depth of his heart, thus recalling the original sin of Adam (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 121)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Now it is precisely the sinner and not the righteous whom Christ addresses, and his major role is to drive out evil spirits and devils, to remit sins (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 122)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Based in large part on the idea of <i>retribution</i>, the notion of sin doubtless leads one to adopt a behavior and speech of conformity, obedience, and self-control under the ruthless gaze of the Other -- Justice, Good, or Golden Mean (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 122)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Neither debt nor want, sin, as the reverse side of love, is a state of fullness, of plenty. In that sense, it turns around into living beauty (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 123)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

The idea of "want" tied to sin as debt and iniquity is therefore coupled with that of an overflowing, a profusion, even an unquenchable desire, which are pejoratively branded with words like "lust" or "greed" (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 123)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

At any rate, those various descriptions of sin converge on the <i>flesh</i> or rather on what might be called, by anticipation, an overwhelming release of drives, unrestrained by the symbolic (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 124)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

One of the most complex nodes of Christian or at least Pauline theory is precisely centered in that matter of the <i>flesh</i>. For on the one hand, the flesh is plainly marked, echoing later Greek thought, as that from which one should be separated ("Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flash, to live after the flesh" Romans 8:12 (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 124)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Was Adam a sinner to begin with, or did he become one of his own "free will"? Does not sin have a mortgage on the power of the spirit and grace? If God can grant remission of sin, can a man, a priest do the same? (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 125)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

A created being that is always already evil, even if free will gives it responsability for sin, such would be the ambiguity of the speaking being. Permanence of sin, existence but restriction of the power of free will -- these will fit into a different pattern in the later Augustinian writings: man is good, but his offense turns human beings into a <i>massa damnata</i> (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 125)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

The brimming flesh of sin belongs, of course, to both sexes; but its root and basic representation is nothing other than faminine temptation (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 126)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Man would thus accede to divine perfection only by sinning, that is, by carrying out the forbidden act of knowledge. Now, the knowledge what would separate him from his natural, animal, and mortal state, enabling him to reach, through thought, purity and freedom, is fundamentally sexual knowledge (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 126)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Seen from a different viewpoint, the story of the fall sets up a diabolical otherness in relation to the divine (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 127)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Meant for remission, sin is what is absorbed -- in and through speech. By the same token, abjection will not be designated as such, that it, as other, as something to be ejected, or separated, but as the most propitious place for communication -- as the point where the scales are tipped towards pure spirituality (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 127)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

A source of evil and mingled with sin, abjection becomes the requisite for a reconciliation, in the mind, between the flesh / and the law (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 127-128)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

For sin, here, subsuming biblical abjection but more closely associated with the passion of the flesh, must carry out the fearsome process of interiorization and spiritualization that I have just discussed (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 128)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

One could say, in fact, that sin is subjectified abjection (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 128)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Sin / as action -- as action stemming from will and judgement -- is what definitively integrates abjection into logic and language (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 128-129)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

If defilement was what is impossible within a system, if Levitical taboo was what is excluded from a Law, sin, on the other hand, is a defect in judgement (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 129)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Speech addressed to the other, not sinful speech but the speech of faith, in pain; this is what locates the act of <i>true communication</i>, the act of avowal, within the register of persecution and victimization (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 129)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

By having it bear that load, which alone grants it the intensity of full communication, avowal absolves from sin and, by the same stroke, founds the power of discourse (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 130)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

But I am concerned with the ultimate interiorization of sin within discourses, by the final postulate that does away with an offense because of its enunciation before the One. An enunciation that amounts to a denunciation (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 130)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

The whole black history of the Crurch shows that condemnation, the fiercest censorship, and punishment are nonetheless the common reality of this practice (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 131)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Power henceforth belongs to discourse itself, or rather to the act of judgement expressed in speech and, in less orthodox and much more implicit fashion, in all the signs (poetry, painting, music, sculpture) that are contingent upon it (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 132)

<h3>KRISTEVA, </h3>

Probably not. Because of knowing it, however, with a knowledge undermined by forgetfulness and laughter, an abject knowledge, he is, she is preparing to go through the first grat demystification of Power (religious, moral, political, and verbal) that mankind has ever witness; and it is necessarily taking place within that fulfillment of religion as sacred horror, which is Judeo-Christian monotheism. In the meantime, let others continue their long march toward idols and truths of all kinds, buttressed with the necessarily righteous faith for wars to come, wars that will necessarily by holy (KRISTEVA, 1982, p. 210)
