            <h3>PRIGOGINE & STENGERS, </h3>
            
            As we said in the Preface, our vision of nature is undergoing
a radical change toward the multiple, the temporal, and the
complex. Curiously, the unexpected complexity that has been
discovered in nature has not led to a slowdown in the progress
of science, but on the contrary to the emergence of new conceptual structures that now appear as essential to our understanding of the physical world-the world that includes us. It
is this new situation, which has no precedent in the history of
science, that we wish to analyze in this book (PRIGOGINE & STENGERS, 1984, p. 02)
            
            <h3>PRIGOGINE & STENGERS, </h3>
            
            Modern science transmuted this fundamentally ethical
stance into what seemed to be an established truth; and this
truth, the reduction of nature to atoms and void, in turn gave
rise to what Lenoble3 has called the "anxiety of modern
men." How can we recognize ourselves in the random world
of the atoms? Must science be defined in terms of rupture between man and nature? ' JI bodies, the firmament, the stars,
the earth and its kingdoms are not equal to the lowest mind;
for mind knows all this in itself and these bodies nothing (PRIGOGINE & STENGERS, 1984, p. 02)
            
            <h3>PRIGOGINE & STENGERS, </h3>
            
            7 In this sense we may say that Western science, which
originated in the seventeenth century, only opened a new
chapter in the everlasting dialogue between man and nature (PRIGOGINE & STENGERS, 1984, p. 02)
            
            <h3>PRIGOGINE & STENGERS, </h3>
            
            Science initiated a successful dialogue with nature. On the
other hand, the first outcome of this dialogue was the discovery of a silent world. This is the paradox of classical science.
It revealed to men a dead, passive nature, a nature that behaves as an automaton which, once programmed, continues to
follow the rules inscribed in the program. In this sense the
dialogue with nature isolated man from nature instead of
bringing him closer to it. A triumph of human reason turned
into a sad truth. It seemed that science debased everything it
touched (PRIGOGINE & STENGERS, 1984, p. 06)
            
            <h3>PRIGOGINE & STENGERS, </h3>
            
            But to understand this
man-made world, we need a science that is not merely a tool
submissive to external interests, nor a cancerous tumor irresponsibly growing on a substrate society (PRIGOGINE & STENGERS, 1984, p. 22)
            
            <h3>PRIGOGINE & STENGERS, </h3>
            
            Thus science leads to a tragic, metaphysical choice. Man has
to choose between the reassuring but irrational temptation to
seek in nature a guarantee of human values, or a sign pointing
to a fundamental corelatedness, and fidelity to a rationality
that isolates him in a silent world (PRIGOGINE & STENGERS, 1984, p. 32)
            
            <h3>PRIGOGINE & STENGERS, </h3>
            
            Any science
that conceives of the world as being governed according to a
universal theoretical plan that reduces its various riches to the
drab applications of general laws thereby becomes an instrument of domination. And man, a stranger to the world, sets
himself up as its master (PRIGOGINE & STENGERS, 1984, p. 32)
            
            <h3>PRIGOGINE & STENGERS, </h3>
            
            Martin Heidegger directs his criticism against the very core
of the scientific endeavor, which he sees as fundamentally related to a permanent aim, the domination of nature. Therefore
Heidegger claims that scientific rationality is the final accomplishment of something that has been implicitly present since
ancient Greece, namely, the will to dominate, which is at work
in any rational discussion or enterprise, the violence lurking in
all positive and communicable knowledge. Heidegger emphasizes what he·calls the technological and scientific "framing"
(Geste/1), 6 which leads to the general setting to work of the
world and of men (PRIGOGINE & STENGERS, 1984, p. 32 )
            
            <h3>PRIGOGINE & STENGERS, </h3>
            
            The dialogue between man and nature was accurately perceived by the founders of modern science as a basic step toward the intelligibility of nature. But their ambitions went even
farther. Galileo, and those who came after him, conceived of
science as being capable of discovering global truths about 
nature. Nature not only would be written in a mathematical
language that can be deciphered by experimentation, but there
would actually exist only one such language (PRIGOGINE & STENGERS, 1984, p. 44)
            
            <h3>PRIGOGINE & STENGERS, </h3>
            
            Perhaps a metaphysical conviction was needed to transmute the craftsman's and machine builder's knowledge into a
new method for the rational exploration of nature. We may
also wonder what the implications of the existence of this kind
of "mythical" conviction are for explaining the way modern
science's first developments were accepted in the social context (PRIGOGINE & STENGERS, 1984, p. 45)
            
            <h3>PRIGOGINE & STENGERS, </h3>
            
            The idea that nature
was governed by simple, knowable laws appeared to them as a
perfect example of anthropocentric foolishness (PRIGOGINE & STENGERS, 1984, p. 48)
            
            <h3>PRIGOGINE & STENGERS, </h3>
            
            The "mechanized" nature of modern science, created and
ruled according to a plan that totally dominates it, but of which
it is unaware , glorifies its creator, and was thus admirably
suited to the needs of both theologians and the physicists. Although Leibniz had endeavored to demonstrate that mathematization is compatible with a world that can display active and
qualitatively differentiated behavior, scientists and theologians
joined forces to describe nature as a mindless, passive mechanics that was basically alien to freedom and the purposes
of the human mind (PRIGOGINE & STENGERS, 1984, p. 50)
            
            <h3>PRIGOGINE & STENGERS, </h3>
            
            Nature thus becomes law-abiding, docile, and predictable, instead of being chaotic, unruly, and stochastic. But
what is the connection between the mortal, unstable world in
which atoms unceasingly combine and separate, and the immutable world of dynamics governed by Newton's law, a siagle
mathematical formula corresponding to an eternal truth unfolding toward a tautological future? In the twentieth century
we are again witnessing the clash between lawfulness and random events, which, as Koyre has shown, had already tormented Descartes (PRIGOGINE & STENGERS, 1984, p. 63)
            
            <h3>PRIGOGINE & STENGERS, </h3>
            
            They contain the general properties of all dynamic changes. Here we have the triumph of the
mathematization of nature. All dynamic change to which classical dynamics applies can be reduced to these simple mathematical equations (PRIGOGINE & STENGERS, 1984, p. 71)
            
            <h3>PRIGOGINE & STENGERS, </h3>
            
            Modern science was born out of the breakdown of the animistic alliance with nature. Man seemed to possess a place in
the Aristotelian world as both a living and a knowing creature (PRIGOGINE & STENGERS, 1984, p. 75)
            
            <h3>PRIGOGINE & STENGERS, </h3>
            
            Nature speaks with a thousand voices, and we have only begun to listen (PRIGOGINE & STENGERS, 1984, p. 77)
            
            <h3>PRIGOGINE & STENGERS, </h3>
            
            We must remember all these developments to understand
what is at stake. To what extent is science a basis for the intelligibility of nature, including man? What is the meaning of the
idea of progress today? (PRIGOGINE & STENGERS, 1984, p. 80)
            
            <h3>PRIGOGINE & STENGERS, </h3>
            
            As for the scientist, his concern with nature would be
reduced to taking it as a set of manipulable and measurable
objects; he would thus be able to take possession of nature, to
dominate and control it but not understand it. Thus the intelligibility of nature would lie beyond the grasp of science (PRIGOGINE & STENGERS, 1984, p. 85)
            
            <h3>PRIGOGINE & STENGERS, </h3>
            
            Hegel's philosophy has cosmic dimensions. In his system increasing levels of complexity are specified, and nature's purpose is the eventual self-realization of its
spiritual element. Nature's history is fulfilled with the appearance of man-that is, with the coming of Spirit apprehending
itself (PRIGOGINE & STENGERS, 1984, p. 89)
            
            <h3>PRIGOGINE & STENGERS, </h3>
            
            No wonder that the principle of the conservation of energy
was so important to nineteenth-century physicists. For many
of them it meant the unification of the whole of nature (PRIGOGINE & STENGERS, 1984, p. 108)
            
            <h3>PRIGOGINE & STENGERS, </h3>
            
            To sum up our argument so far, equilibrium thermodynamics was the first response of physics to the problem of nature's
complexity. This response was expressed in terms of the dissipation of energy, the forgetting of initial conditions, and evolution toward disorder (PRIGOGINE & STENGERS, 1984, p. 129)
            
            <h3>PRIGOGINE & STENGERS, </h3>
            
            Like doctrines such as
Adam Smith's invisible hand or other definitions of progress in
terms of maximization or minimization criteria, this gives a
reassuring representation of nature as an all-powerful and rational calculator, and of a coherent history characterized by
global progress. To restore both inertia and the possibility of
unanticipated events-that is, restore the open character of
history-we must accept its fundamental uncertainty. Here we
could use as a symbol the apparently accidental character of
the great cretaceous extinction that cleared the path for the
development of mammals, a small group of ratlike creatures (PRIGOGINE & STENGERS, 1984, p. 207)
            
            <h3>PRIGOGINE & STENGERS, </h3>
            
            At that time it was still
possible to subscribe to the fiction that irreversibility was only
a result of our ineptitude, of our unsophisticated machines,
and that nature remained fundamentally reversible. Now it is no longer possible: today even physics tells us that irreversible
processes play a constructive and indispensable role (PRIGOGINE & STENGERS, 1984, p. 208-209)
            
            <h3>PRIGOGINE & STENGERS, </h3>
            
            It is a physics that presupposes an
observer situated within the observed world . .Our dialogue
with nature will be successful only if it is carried on from
within nature (PRIGOGINE & STENGERS, 1984, p. 218)
            
            <h3>PRIGOGINE & STENGERS, ENTROPIA</h3>
            
            It is from the negative aspect that the positive aspect emerges: the existence of entropy together with its
probability interpretation. Irreversibility no longer emerges as
if by a miracle at some macroscopic level. Macroscopic irreversibility only makes apparent the time-oriented polarized
nature of the universe in which we live (PRIGOGINE & STENGERS, 1984, p. 285)
            
            <h3>PRIGOGINE & STENGERS, ALEATORIEDADE</h3>
            
            Is
nature intrinsically random? Is ordered behavior merely the
transient result of the chance collisions of atoms and of their
unstable associations? (PRIGOGINE & STENGERS, 1984, p. 291)
            
            <h3>PRIGOGINE & STENGERS, IRREVERSIBILIDADE</h3>
            
            A new unity is emerging: irreversibility is a source of order
at all levels. Irreversibility is the mechanism that brings order
out of chaos. How could such a radical transformation of our
views on nature occur in the relatively short time span of the
past few decades? We believe that it shows the important role
intellectual construction plays in our concept of reality (PRIGOGINE & STENGERS, 1984, p. 292)
            
            <h3>PRIGOGINE & STENGERS, TERMODINÂMICA</h3>
            
            In the case of thermodynamics, a certain
situation is defined as being absent from nature; in the case of
relativity, it is an observation that is defined as impossiblethat is, a type of dialogue, of communication between nature
and the person who describes it (PRIGOGINE & STENGERS, 1984, p. 296)
            
            <h3>PRIGOGINE & STENGERS, IMPOSSIBILIDADE</h3>
            
            Demonstrations of impossibility, whether in relativity, quantum mechanics, or thermodynamics, have shown
us that nature cannot be described "from the outside," as if by
a spectator. Description is dialogue, communication, and this
communication is subject to constraints that demonstrate that
we are macroscopic beings embedded in the physical world (PRIGOGINE & STENGERS, 1984, p. 299-300)
            
            <h3>PRIGOGINE & STENGERS, NATUREZA, HUMANIDADE</h3>
            
            It is quite remarkable that we are at a moment both of profound change in the scientific concept of nature and of the
structure of human society as a result of the demographic explosion. As a result, there is a need for new relations between
man and nature and between man and man (PRIGOGINE & STENGERS, 1984, p. 312)
