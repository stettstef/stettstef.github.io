<h3>WALKER, </h3>

Athena Lynn Michaels-Dillon had also come up with the term
independently and had also been playing around with it, letting it simmer,
and thinking about putting it into publication eventually. Another dear
friend and colleague, Remi Yergeau, who was also in that discussion,
revealed that although the term neuroqueer was new for them, they’d been
thinking along quite similar and compatible lines in playing with the
concept of “neurological queerness.” (WALKER, 2021, não p.)

<h3>WALKER, </h3>

I should first of all acknowledge that any effort to establish an
“authoritative” definition of neuroqueer is in some sense inherently doomed
and ridiculous, simply because the sort of people who identify as
neuroqueer and engage in neuroqueering tend to be the sort of people who
delight in subverting definitions, concepts, and authority. (WALKER, 2021, não p.)

<h3>WALKER, </h3>

neuroqueering as the
practice of queering (subverting, defying, disrupting, liberating oneself
from) neuronormativity and heteronormativity simultaneously. It was an
extension of the way queer is used as a verb in Queer Theory; I was
expanding the Queer Theory conceptualization of queering to encompass
the queering of neurocognitive norms as well as gender norms—and, in the
process, I was examining how socially-imposed neuronormativity and
socially-imposed heteronormativity were entwined with one another, and
how the queering of either of those two forms of normativity entwined with
and blended into the queering of the other one. (WALKER, 2021, não p.)

<h3>WALKER, </h3>

As a verb, it refers to a broad range
of interrelated practices. As an adjective, it describes things that are
associated with those practices or that result from those practices:
neuroqueer theory, neuroqueer perspectives, neuroqueer embodiments, neuroqueer narratives, neuroqueer literature, neuroqueer art, neuroqueer
culture, neuroqueer spaces. (WALKER, 2021, não p.)

<h3>WALKER, </h3>

One can neuroqueer, and one can be neuroqueer (WALKER, 2021, não p.)

<h3>WALKER, </h3>

you’re
neuroqueer if you neuroqueer (WALKER, 2021, não p.)

<h3>WALKER, </h3>

1. Being both neurodivergent and queer, with some degree of
conscious awareness and/or active exploration around how these
two aspects of one’s being entwine and interact (or are, perhaps,
mutually constitutive and inseparable). 2. Embodying and expressing one’s neurodivergence in ways that
also queer one’s performance of gender, sexuality, ethnicity,
and/or other aspects of one’s identity. 3. Engaging in practices intended to undo and subvert one’s own
cultural conditioning and one’s ingrained habits of
neuronormative and heteronormative performance, with the aim of
reclaiming one’s capacity to give more full expression to one’s
uniquely weird potentials and inclinations. 4. Engaging in the queering of one’s own neurocognitive processes
(and one’s outward embodiment and expression of those
processes) by intentionally altering them in ways that create significant and lasting increase in one’s divergence from
prevailing cultural standards of neuronormativity and
heteronormativity. 5. Approaching, embodying, and/or experiencing one’s
neurodivergence as a form of queerness (e.g., in ways that are
inspired by, or similar to, the ways in which queerness is
understood and approached in Queer Theory, Gender Studies,
and/or queer activism). 
6. Producing literature, art, scholarship, and/or other cultural artifacts
that foreground neuroqueer experiences, perspectives, and voices. 
7. Producing critical responses to literature and/or other cultural
artifacts, focusing on intentional or unintentional characterizations
of neuroqueerness and how those characterizations illuminate
and/or are illuminated by actual neuroqueer lives and experiences. 
8. Working to transform social and cultural environments in order to
create spaces and communities—and ultimately a society—in
which engagement in any or all of the above practices is
permitted, accepted, supported, and encouraged (WALKER, 2021, não p.)
